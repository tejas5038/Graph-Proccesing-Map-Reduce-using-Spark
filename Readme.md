# Single Source Shortest Distance using Spark
Spark program to find the single source shortest distance problem: for each node in a directed graph, it calculate the shortest distance from the node with id=0 to this node. 
The input directed graph is a dataset of edges, where an edge from the node i to the node j is represented in the input text file as:
i,d,j
where d is the distance from node i to node j. (Numbers i,j, and d are long integers.)
